custom makefiles made from various pages... 
minimal requirements are: 
    - 2 makefiles: 1 for engine and 1 for app (unlike How to setup Vulkan)
    - MacOs support but code ready to add support for linux / windows.
    - No extra build.sh build_all.sh
    - compile / link etc... command of Kohi are not ok.
