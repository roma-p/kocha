platform_macos.m
-> renamed to c (and patched) on livestream from 5 september. 
-> .c created on 17 august.
    -> video of 20 august: no macos.c (at least at 10mins)
    -> added out of stream... no exploantions, best I can do is copy paste stuff.

missing glfw / glm (brew it)

# 15/12/22 -------------------------------------------------------------------

custom makefiles made from various pages... 
minimal requirements are: 
    - 2 makefiles: 1 for engine and 1 for app (unlike How to setup Vulkan)
    - MacOs support but code ready to add support for linux / windows.
    - No extra build.sh build_all.sh
    - compile / link etc... command of Kohi are not ok.
